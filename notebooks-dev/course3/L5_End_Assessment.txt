List of potential questions for L5 (Data Science on Deployed Node):

Passive Learning/Long Answer:

- What does a data scientist's privacy budget represent?
- Can a data scientist access data on a node directly?
- Does a data scientist have the same access to a node that a domain owner does? If not, how does their access differ?
- Is it possible to do machine learning with data that has been passed through Privacy Enhancing Technologies? Why or why not?
- Does a data scientist see the same errors that a domain owner does?

Active Learning/Multiple Choice:

- A data scientist working on your domain is attempting to access data via `publish` calls, and is receiving an error. Should you:
(a) Check the server log to see what errors are being raised
(b) Tell the data scientist to check their privacy budget
(c) Ensure that the data scientist has an account on your domain
(d) All of the above

- The same data scientist manages to access some data, and sends you an email saying that the data appears corrupted or incorrect. What shouldn't you do?

(a) Point the data scientist to an explanation of PETs and privacy budgets
(b) Tell them to increase the sigma parameter on their `publish` calls
(c) Delete the data and recreate it


- As the domain owner, you want to see what data scientists see, and decide to access the node from your own account. Check any actions below that you can perform that a normal data scientist cannot:

[ ] Deleting the data
[ ] Seeing the data without noise
[ ] Performing machine learning and statistical operations on the data
[ ] Adding new users to the node

- True or False: each dataset on a node has a unique ID.

- True or False: data scientists who do NOT own the domain have access to each dataset's metadata (unique ID, asset listing, etc.).
